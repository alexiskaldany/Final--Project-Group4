## Setup

1. Create the virtual env and install the dependencies:
``` bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Inside `dialogsum.py`,

3. To train the model, use the following code (just run dialogsum.py):

```
nohup python3 /home/ubuntu/Final--Project-Group4/code/dialogsum.py &
```

nohup allows our scripts to keep running even if the ssh connection closes to our EC2

## Notes

- It takes roughly 70 minutes to run a complete epoch. 
- Currently the training loop saves the model after each epoch, so even if the EC2 is shut down we won't lose all of the progress.

### Statistical Output

- The evaluation loop and the test loop have the richest data, and includes the actual predicted summary generated by the model.
- The training loop only records rouge1 score and loss for each step.
- Averages are calculated for the evalution and test loops and saved to a csv as well
