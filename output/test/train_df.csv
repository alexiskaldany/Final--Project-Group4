#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.

#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.

#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.

#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.

#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.

#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.

#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.

#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.

#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.

#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.

#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.

#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
